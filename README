Tempo Server is the reference implementation for the Tempo API [1].
It is an all-in-one music server and a library manager. This allows for a
greater quality of metadata collection and integration, compared to what is
possible via simple audio tags. The collection management functionality include:

1. Importing of releaes
2. Fetching releases's artwork
3. Fetching artists's urls on other platforms
4. Fetching artists's pictures from
5. Fetching artists's descriptions

All the tasks from 3 onwards can be automated and run periodically, to keep
your music collection up to date.

On the other hand, Tempo implements the Tempo API which offers the following
features as a media streaming server:

- Browsing of all artists, with advanced filtering
- Browsing of all releases, with advanced filtering
- Browsing of all tracks, with advanced filtering
- Full-text, typo tolerant search for artists, releases, tracks
- Displaying artists and releases
- Support for multi valued tags everywhere (it makes sense to):
  1. track artist
  2. release artists
  3. genres
- Support for join phrases for multi valued artists
- Scrobbling to any service (currently only support last.fm)
