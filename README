A music tagger pulling metadata from MusicBrainz and album arts from a iTunes
and CoverArtArchive (more to come). Multi-valued tags support is a first-class
citizen along with speedy performance (compared to Beets).

You can find prebuild releases for Linux x86_64, aarch64, i686 on the Releases
page. If you are on a different platform (for now) compiling from source is the
only option:

$ cargo build --release

A list of all available commands can be obtained by running the program with no
arguments. Some of the most frequently used include:
- import [path]: recursively scans the `path` and tries to import all music
  files as a single release in your music library
- list: lists all music files in your library currently being managed by the
  tagger
- config: prints the current config. The output can be piped in the default 
  configuration path, in order to generate a starting config:

  $ mkdir -p "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME}"/.config/tagger
  $ tagger config > "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME}"/.config/tagger/config.toml
